# Meal Planner
A program that returns you a list of meals. It's supposed to help you decide what meals to have (whether you need help deciding what to have on one day or planning your meals for the week). 
- the program should ask you for a number of options
- it should then return a list of meals (with the same number of meals you asked for) 
- it will then ask you if you would like to generate some more
